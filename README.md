*To avoid pain and suffering, don't change file structure.

Current Progress:
- Preprocessing:
  - Image vectors have same dimension. 
  - Matrix is standardized by column (feature) mean and column standard deviation.
  - PCA is complete (<500 PCs explain >80% of total variance)-- shown in project_draft.ipynb.
- Modelling: (In Progress)
  - Logistic Regression
  - QDA
  - kNN
